The error message might vary, but generally indicates a problem with the project's configuration, build process, or dependencies.  A common symptom is that the app won't build or start successfully.  Specific errors might involve missing dependencies, issues with native modules, or conflicts within the project files.  Debugging often requires careful examination of the complete error log to pinpoint the root cause.
