# Uncommon Expo CLI Errors and Debugging Strategies

This repository demonstrates uncommon errors encountered when using the Expo CLI and provides solutions to address them. The errors often manifest during project setup, build processes, or runtime and are not always straightforward to resolve.

**Key areas covered:**

*   Analyzing cryptic error messages from the Expo CLI.
*   Identifying issues related to package versions and dependencies.
*   Troubleshooting problems with native modules.
*   Handling unexpected configuration settings in `app.json` or `package.json`.

**Note:**  Specific solutions are context-dependent.  Each error scenario may require a tailored approach. The examples here illustrate common strategies rather than providing a universal fix.
