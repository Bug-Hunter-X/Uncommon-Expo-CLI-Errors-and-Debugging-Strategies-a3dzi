Debugging Expo CLI errors requires a systematic approach:

1. **Examine the Complete Error Log:**  Pay close attention to the full error message, including stack traces and any preceding warnings.  This often reveals the source of the problem.
2. **Verify Package Versions:** Check your `package.json` file.  Outdated or conflicting dependency versions are a common cause of errors.  Try updating packages to their latest compatible versions using `npm update` or `yarn upgrade`.
3. **Inspect Native Modules:**  If the error involves native modules, ensure they are correctly configured and linked. Use the Expo documentation for guidance on integrating and troubleshooting native modules.
4. **Clean and Rebuild:**  Sometimes, cached files can cause problems. Try cleaning the project's cache using `expo prebuild --clean` or similar commands, followed by a fresh rebuild.
5. **Check Configuration Files:** Review `app.json` for any typos or incorrect configurations.  Ensure that the configuration settings align with the capabilities of your Expo project.
6. **Reproduce the Error:**  If possible, try to reproduce the error in a minimal example project to isolate the issue.  This helps in narrowing down the cause.
7. **Consult the Expo Documentation:** The Expo documentation is an invaluable resource for troubleshooting.  Search for specific error messages or consult the troubleshooting sections for guidance.
8. **Community Forums:**  If you're still stuck, consider posting the problem and error log on the Expo community forums.  Others might have encountered similar issues and can offer solutions.
